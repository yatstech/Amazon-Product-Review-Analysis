## Problem Statement
The traditional manual process of analyzing Amazon product reviews is time-consuming, inefficient, and lacks the ability to identify trends and patterns over time. Understanding customer sentiments towards products and their delivery becomes challenging, hindering businesses' ability to make data-driven decisions.

The problem at hand is the need for a system that can analyze and predict the sentiments expressed in Amazon product reviews. This system should leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and Time Series Analysis to gain valuable insights into customer sentiments and address various business problems.

## Approach
The project employs several techniques, including Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Clustering, and Time Series Analysis, to address the problem statement effectively.

The reviews are classified into three sentiments: positive, negative, and neutral, using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool. Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing technique that converts unstructured text into analyzable data, helping businesses categorize and differentiate opinions about their products, services, and brand image.

To achieve the project objectives, the following technologies are used:

## Technologies Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Wordcloud

## Project Objectives
1. Reviews Preprocessing and Cleaning: Perform data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare the reviews for analysis.
2. Visualization using Tableau : To understand data in better and fast way using tableau.
3. Extracting Features from Cleaned Reviews: Extract relevant features from the cleaned reviews to be used in subsequent analysis.
4. Model Building: Sentiment Analysis: Build a model to classify the sentiment of reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
5. Model Building: Clustering: Apply clustering techniques to group similar reviews together.
6. Model Building: Time Series Analysis: Use time series analysis to identify trends and patterns in the sentiment of reviews over time.

## Data Source Files
The project utilizes data from Amazon product reviews as the primary data source. The specific data files and their formats will be provided or can be obtained from publicly available datasets.

I have used 4 datasets in this project are :

Beauty Products dataset - reviews

Beauty Products dataset - metadata

Clothing and Jewellery brand Dataset - reviews

Clothing and Jewellery brand Dataset - metadata


By leveraging the power of NLP and time series analysis, this project aims to provide valuable insights into customer sentiments, marketing campaigns, and ultimately improving the success rate of existing and new products on Amazon.
